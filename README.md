# Attendance-System-with-Face-Recognition-using-Python

For every organization, today attendance is the most important thing to record the presence of someone. The presence of someone in an organization is a sign that the person is carrying out their obligations to come to the agency or organization. Usually, attendance is done manually. It can be signed or called one by one. In this digital age, there must be a change from this absence to be able to accelerate and provide time efficiency. We can use face recognition to record attendance from everyone present in an organization. In this face recognition, many algorithms are performed to dissect and capture images of someone’s face, such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning. With this algorithm, the system can recognize a person’s face and record attendance from that person so that attendance activities are more efficient and even faster.
